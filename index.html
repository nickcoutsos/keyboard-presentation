Usually this sharing happens at the end of the project, but in this case it was before I could even test the laser-cutting so there was an extra feeling of vulerability. Also this background animation was a lot of fun to make.</p></section><div id="app"></div><div id="slideshow-progress"><div id="meter"></div></div></body></html>
