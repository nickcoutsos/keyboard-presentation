# Keyboard Presentation

I threw together a presentation to talk about an ergonomic keyboard I'm building and different keyboard layouts.

You won't get a lot out of it without audio and the presenter but the effects are nice.

[Keyboard Presentation](https://nickcoutsos.github.io/keyboard-presentation/) on github pages. Advance slides with arrow keys. You'll know when you're done.
